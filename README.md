This is a 3D model of a film cartridge suitable for the Mamiya-16 series of subminiature film cameras. It's a model of what [Subclub](http://www.subclub.org/darkroom/rollmami.htm) calls a "Type D" cassette. This is a bridged plastic cassette with a spool in the take-up side, and a solid-capped supply side. It can be loaded in the same way.

Print in PETG, 0.1mm layer height, 4 perimeters. The part is thin-walled, so all but the base should be perimeters. I've also printed these in ABS, but don't recommend it as the thin walls make it very hard to accurately and reliably print.

Use OpenSCAD to generate STL files (press F6, then Export STL).
